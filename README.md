# Places

**Places** is a monorepo containing a web application and a GraphQL API server that allows users to save and interact with their favorite locations on a 3D globe.
With a user-friendly interface and an intuitive design, Places makes it easy for users to keep track of memorable places they've visited or want to explore in the future.

## üåç Features

- **Interactive 3D Globe:** Visualize saved places on a globe, with smooth navigation and zoom controls.

- **Add and Manage Places:** Users can save, edit, and remove places they‚Äôve visited or plan to visit.

- **Detailed Map View:** Clicking on a saved place opens a more detailed map view of that location, providing additional insights and a closer look at the area.

- **Search and Explore:** Integrated search functionality for quick access to specific locations.

## Project Structure

This monorepo is organized into two main parts:

- **Web Application:** Built with Vue.js and Three.js, the web app provides an interactive 3D globe interface where users can save and view their favorite places. Clicking on any saved place opens a more detailed map view of the location.

- **GraphQL API Server:** A GraphQL server that manages and serves place data to the web application. The server handles all CRUD operations, making it easy to interact with saved data efficiently and flexibly.

The Places app is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Vue, TypeScript, globe.gl

- **Backend**: TypeScript, Express.js, GraphQL
